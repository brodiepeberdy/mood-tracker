# Personal Mood Tracker

This mood tracker is a Django application for tracking your mood daily, and commenting on positive and negative changes. This is a work in progress, as a means of developing my skills in Django and relevant languages. Please click [here](https://youtu.be/eEnLcDbrPxo) for a demonstration of the website.

Users can create a sort of diary entry each day to track how they were feeling mentally on a scale of 1-5, any comments on their mental health, and positives and negatives about it. The intention is for users to be able to easily track and visualise how their mental health has been recently and see what needs improving, say for example their therapist wanted them to conduct a daily journal.

The current version is not deployed, as I am interested in adding some sort of data visualisation page for tracking one's trends in mental wellbeing.
